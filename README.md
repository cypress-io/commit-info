## Install

Requires [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 6 or above.

```sh
npm install --save @cypress/commit-info
```

## Use

```js
const {commitInfo} = require('@cypress/commit-info')
// default folder is current working directory
commitInfo(folder)
  .then(info => {
    // info object will have properties
    // branch
    // message
    // email
    // author
    // sha
    // timestamp (in seconds since epoch)
    // remote
  })
```

Notes:

- Code assumes there is `.git` folder and uses Git commands to get each property, like `git show -s --pretty=%B`, see [src/git-api.js](src/git-api.js). Note: there is fallback to environment variables.
- Resolves with [Bluebird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird) promise.
- Only uses Git commands, see [src/git-api.js](src/git-api.js)
- If a command fails, returns `null` for each property
- If you need to debug, run with `DEBUG=commit-info` environment variable.

## Fallback environment variables

If getting the commit information using `git` fails for some reason, you can provide the commit information by setting the environment variables. This module will look at the following environment variables as a fallback

```
branch: COMMIT_INFO_BRANCH
message: COMMIT_INFO_MESSAGE
email: COMMIT_INFO_EMAIL
author: COMMIT_INFO_AUTHOR
sha: COMMIT_INFO_SHA
timestamp: COMMIT_INFO_TIMESTAMP
remote: COMMIT_INFO_REMOTE
```

### For Docker containers

When running your application inside a Docker container, you should set these environment variables using `-e` syntax.

```shell
$ docker run \
  -e COMMIT_INFO_BRANCH=develop \
  -e COMMIT_INFO_SHA=e5d9eb66474bc0b681da9240aa5a457fe17bc8f3 \
  <container name>
```

See [docker-example](docker-example) for a full example.

## Individual methods

In addition to `commitInfo` this module also exposes individual promise-returning
methods `getBranch`, `getMessage`, `getEmail`, `getAuthor`, `getSha`, `getTimestamp`, `getRemoteOrigin`. These methods do NOT use fallback environment variables.

For example

```js
const {getAuthor} = require('@cypress/commit-info')
getAuthor('path/to/repo')
  .then(name => ...)
```

### getBranch

Resolves with the current git branch name or `null`.

```js
const {getBranch} = require('@cypress/commit-info')
getBranch()
  .then(branch => ...)
```

- If this is detached commit (reporting `HEAD`), returns `null`

### Small print
